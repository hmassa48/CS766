Discuss generateHoughAccumulator.m : 

In this file, I work to generate a hough accumulator. 
I am converting to polar coordinates like the notes using the equation: 
You are right that you can get some base point at the line as
(X0, Y0) = (rho * cos(theta), rho * sin(theta))
With this I am able to find a voting function for a line (and my voting function), that 
uses these new polar coordinates. I also want to take into account the perpendicular line.
With help from Wikipedia, I found that the radial line perpendicular to the point has the equation:
 r(?) = r0 * sec(? - ?).
If ro and ? are the coordinates for our line, I get the equation: 
r(?) * cos(?) * cos(?) + r(?) * sin(?) * sin(?) - r0 = 0
And so the equation for the line becomes: 
x * cos(?) + y * sin(?) - r0 = 0
Using the notes for line detector from the class, however,
